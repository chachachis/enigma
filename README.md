This repository is based on a C++ coursework for MSc Computing Science students by the Department of Computing, Imperial College London.

An Enigma machine is an encryption device widely by Nazi Germany in World War II to encrypt communications and protect against enemy interception.
Further details on the structure and method of encryption can be found on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).

This project implements each component of Enigma as an object and configures each object based on input files passed in as command line arguments.
